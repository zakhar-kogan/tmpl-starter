# Helper Index

Machine-facing helper memory for recurring failures and repeatable workflows.

## Usage
1. Read this index at task startup.
2. Reuse existing helpers when triggers match.
3. After a failure review, update an existing helper or add a new one.
4. Keep entries short and operational; promote stable guidance into `RUNBOOK.md` or `PATTERNS.md`.

## Entry format
- `H-YYYY-MM-DD__slug` — `Status:<ACTIVE|STABLE|RETIRED>` — `Path:<repo-relative path>` — `Scope:<where it applies>` — `Summary:<one line>`

## Active Helpers
